##  AI & Machine Learning Portfolio – Kevin Garrett  

My name is **Kevin Garrett**, and this repository is where I document my journey in **AI and Machine Learning**.  
Over the next few weeks, I'll be showcasing **projects that focus on cleaning data, building models, and deploying AI solutions**.  

Our models are only as good as the **quality of the data** we work with.  
Each project here will emphasize **understanding the data**, **engineering meaningful features**, and **ensuring models perform in real-world scenarios**.

---

##  **What This Repo Covers**  

- **R for Machine Learning** – Developing ML models, tuning hyperparameters, and visualizing data-driven insights in R.  
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handling missing data, feature engineering, and dataset preparation.  
- **Building & Optimizing ML Models** – Supervised and unsupervised learning applied to structured and unstructured data.  
- **AI Automation & Deployment** – Deploying models into Salesforce AI, APIs, and automated workflows.  
- **NLP & Predictive Analytics** – Sentiment analysis, fraud detection, and customer behavior prediction.  

This repo is a mix of **R, Python, and cloud-based AI integrations**, focusing on practical applications beyond just running `.fit()`.

##  **Repository Structure**  


## **Pre-Projects: Foundational Machine Learning Work**  

These projects laid the foundation for my work in **machine learning and AI**. They cover **basic R programming, data preprocessing, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and hyperparameter tuning**.

### ** 1. First R Script (Basic Operations & Syntax Learning)**  
- **Script:** [`My First R script.R`](scripts/pre_projects/My_First_R_script.R)  
- **Goal:** Get familiar with **basic R operations and syntax**.  
- **Methods:** Arithmetic operations, script execution, and console interaction.  

---

### ** 2. Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Service Classification**  
- **Script:** [`Module2Lab.R`](scripts/pre_projects/Module2Lab.R)  
- **Goal:** Predict **service levels** based on **anxiety and drug misuse scores**.  
- **Methods:** Data cleaning, feature engineering, and training an **SVM model** for classification.  

---

### ** 3. Hyperparameter Tuning in SVM**  
- **Script:** [`modulelast.R`](scripts/pre_projects/modulelast.R)  
- **Goal:** **Optimize SVM model performance** by adjusting hyperparameters.  
- **Methods:** Fine-tuning the **cost parameter** to improve classification accuracy.
